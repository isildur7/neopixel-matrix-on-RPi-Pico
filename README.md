# Getting Started with RPi Pico

## Step 1: Installing Thonny
Go to [this link](https://thonny.org/) and download thonny. Install it with the default settings. After installation, you can also go to Tools > Options... > Theme & Font to set the appearance and make it comfortable for you.
## Step 2: Installing Micropython Firmware onto the RPi Pico
To run micropython on our RPi Pico, we need to install some firmware on it. We can use thonny for this too. To do this, in thonny go to Tools > Options... In options, go to the interpreter tab. At this point, you will also have to plug in your RPi Pico using a USB cable so keep it handy. In this tab, in the bottom right corner will be an option called "Install or update firmware". Click on that and follow the instructions.  
## Step 3: Play Round!
> The Pico runs a lightweight interpreter called REPL (Read Evaluate Print Loop). It allows us to write commands and execute them on the Pico in real time just like command line.

So, just try typing ```print("Hello World!")``` in the shell and see the output. That instruction was run on the RPi Pico! :partying_face:
